# TREE_VISUALIZER

A binary tree is a type of data structure for storing data such as numbers in an organized way.
Binary Search Tree is a special type of Bnary tree which has the following properties:  
1) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
2)The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
3)Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Storing data in Binary tree datastructre helps in easy retrieval of data
The project contains code to program which allows visualisation of tree data structure and store data in Binary Search tree for for faster retreival during runtime. The data is not sorted during runtime but stores in trees to allow accessing data n complexity of O(n)
