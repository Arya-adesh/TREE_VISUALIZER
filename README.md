# TREE_VISUALIZER

A binary tree is a type of data structure for storing data such as numbers in an organized way.
Binary Search Tree is a special type of Binary tree which has the following properties:  
1) The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
2) The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
3) Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Storing data in Binary tree data structre helps in easy retrieval of data
The project contains code to program which allows visualisation of tree data structure and store data in Binary Search tree for  faster retreival during runtime. The data is not sorted during runtime but stored in trees to allow accessing data n complexity of O(n) 
Real time uses:
1) Visual debugger: creates data structures through graphics if the code is correct
2) manage orders in real time scenario.
